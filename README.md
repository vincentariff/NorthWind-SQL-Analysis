## Introduction

* In this project, acting as a Data Analyst for Northwind Traders, a global gourmet food distributor, I will provide insights to guide strategic decisions in four areas:
    * boosting employee productivity
    * optimizing product sales and inventory
    * analyzing sales trends for forecasting
    * targeting high-value customers with promotions using SQL.

*  Insights:
  
    - Staff Performance: Top 3 employees by sales are Margaret Peacock, Janet Leverling, and Nancy Davolio.
    - Sales Performance: December 1997 saw the highest growth, while May 1998 had the largest drop.
    - Products: Top categories are Beverages, Dairy Products, and Confections.
    - Customers: Customers with the most above-average orders are SAVEA, ERNSH, and QUICK.

* We explored various tables in the database and utilized SQL techniques such as Window Functions, aggregate functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, ranking functions, and more.
